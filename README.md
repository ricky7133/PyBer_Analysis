# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of PyBer Analysis
The purpose of this analysis on the PyBer data was to create graphs and represent the data from type of city and weekly fares. We compared the type of city and the weekly fares that those city types (urban, suburban and rural) received in order to improve acces to the ride sharing service.

## Results

The data frame shows us that the highest average fare per ride is in rural city types even though they have a fare less amount of total rides when compared to urban and suburban. Rural city types also made less in total fare. For urban city types, they had the lowest amount of average fare per ride but also have the highest amount of total rides and total fares.

The multiple line graph displays the same thing as the data frame. In the line graph, we can see that from January of 2019 to the end of April, urban city types had a higher amount of total fares. The multiple line graph is a helpfully visualization tool because we visuale the differnce between the city types.
## Summary
Based of the results form this analysis, some recommendations to imporve would be:
- Increasing the amount of drivers in rural areas so that more rides are able to be given.
- Investing in urban areas so that more rides are taken and in turn, drivers are able to make more per drive. This would incentives drivers to keep driving with PyBer.
- With the investing into urban areas, investing during the early months of the year would be helpful as the data shows total rides are lower in the first two months.
